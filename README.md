# Neuron-model implementation for cerebellum learning

This repository includes several neuron and synapsis models allowing the implementation of cerebellar models in NEST. It also includes other NEST nodes to make more efficient the simulation of the cerebellar model in the HBP Neurorobotics Platform. Tested with Nest 2.18.

The NEST modules have been implemented by Jes√∫s Garrido (jesusgarrido@ugr.es). For any question, please, do not hesitate to email me.
